# Developing machine learning and deep learning systems for classification and regression

This repository contains the final project I developed during my Advanced School in Artificial Intelligence (AS-AI). [Here](./Certificate_of_Attendance_Maglianella.pdf) you can find the Certificate of Attendance with details on courses attended and projects accomplished.

The project consists of building machine learning and deep learning systems for classification and regression tasks. [Here](./Project_outline_Maglianella.pdf) you can find an outline of the project. You can find the classification task [here](./Final_Project_Maglianella_Classifier.ipynb) and the regression task [here](./Final_Project_Maglianella_Regressor.ipynb). Check out the [report](./Final_Project_Report_Maglianella.pdf) for full details.
